                <p>My Podd podcast application uses the Fetch API to pull podcast data and display it to the user for listening
                    capabilities.
                
                    A user is capable of selecting a show, followed by a season and selecting an episode from that season.
                
                    A user is also capable of adding an episode of a show to their favourites allowing them to view them seperately and
                    add and remove them as they please, along with being able to sort them alphabetically and by recently updated.
                
                    Listening history as well as completed episodes are saved by the application and the user is able to reset all their
                    history.
                
                    A user is able to filter the shows on their dashboard alphabetically and by the most recently updated shows, a user
                    is also able to filter their shows by genre and by using a searchbar.</p>
                
                
                <p>For this project I used React and Vite with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS to complete it, I decided to go with
                    TypeScript due to its interface capabilities which helped a lot during data capturing and processing, I used
                    Tailwind CSS for easier inline CSS and the ability for easier responsive design, my project is only responsive for
                    desktop, but using Tailwind allows me to easily change that if I were to want to.</p>
                
                
                <p>Some of the challenges I faced during the completion of this project included learning TypeScript on the go as before
                    this project I was only exposed to React and Vanilla JavaScript, other challenges included importing different
                    components from Bootstrap and Framer-Motion, as the styling for these components weren't necessarily integrated into
                    Tailwind CSS, so I had to figure out a way to combine both. State management with React also was quite difficult
                    since TypeScript forces you to define state datatypes and so on, so learning the syntax was tedious.</p>
